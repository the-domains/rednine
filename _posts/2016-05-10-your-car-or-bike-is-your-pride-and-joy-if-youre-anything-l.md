Your car or bike is your pride and joy. If you're anything like me you've spent far too much time and far too much money on it. Why not celebrate this by hanging it on your wall? 

I photograph aeroplanes, automobiles, motorcycles and any other vehicles in Melbourne, Sydney, Brisbane and worldwide. I photograph for various commercial clients and magazines, as well as individual enthusiasts.

As an enthusiast myself I have put together a few options that can be personalised to your own needs. I have options including albums, wall art and canvas prints. I can also offer metallic prints as well as glass and acrylic wall mounts. With an investment from as little as 995, including an album and wall art, we can work out a personalised package to suit you.

To enquire about a package, or to design your own, please click the 'contact me' button at the top of the page, or alternately give me a call on 07 3193 8989\. I look forward to shooting your machine.
