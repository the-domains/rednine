A good headshot or portrait will show your personality and values in a single photograph. It's much more than a simple snap. 

There are no time limits on my sittings. I don't rush you in and rush you out. It's a personalised session tailored specifically to you. With an investment of as little as 350, I have a few packages that cover the basics and each one can be customised as necessary to get the perfect result. The portrait sittings can be taken at my East Brisbane Studio or at a location of your choosing. I regularly travel to Melbourne, Sydney and Adelaide for my clients, and travel anywhere in the world on request.

Executive Portraits.  
A simple package suited to corporate clients or if you just need a quick update. Whether you've just landed a new job, a promotion or it's time for your annual update, this package will be a good basis for your personal portrait session. This package also makes a great basis for social media and profile photos, and again, it can be personalised to your specific needs. It includes two finished photographs that are ready to show. This session usually takes approximately one hour, but there is no time limit and I will stick with you until we get the perfect photograph.

Actors and Models Headshots and Portfolios.  
This is a little more comprehensive than the Corporate Package and is ideal for an actor, model or other creative to update their portfolio or lookbook. This session usually takes around two hours, but the time is not limited and we can take as much as we need to get it just right. The Actors and Models Package allows for up to three wardrobe changes, includes five finished headshots as well as an 'expressions' grid or a set of 'polaroids', or 'digitals', as they're now known.

Personalised Portraits.  
A package designed for you. Whether you're an individual or a couple, after an album or some fine wall art this package is for you.

To enquire about one of these packages, or to design your own, please click the 'contact me' button at the top of the page, or alternately give me a call on 07 3193 8989\. I look forward to shooting you.
