            <description><![CDATA[<p>A good headshot or portrait will show your personality and values in a single photograph. It's much more than a simple snap. There are no time limits on my sittings. I don’t rush you in and rush you out. It’s a personalised session tailored specifically to you. I have a few packages that cover the basics and each one can be customised as necessary to get the perfect result for you, with an investment of as little as 350. All of these packages can be done at my East Brisbane Studio or at a location of your choosing. I regularly travel to Melbourne, Sydney and Brisbane for my clients, and travel anywhere in the world.</p>]]></description>
